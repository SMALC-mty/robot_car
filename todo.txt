-- traction control / skew rate limiter
+ fine tune line follower
+ change driver pins to allow separate Enable PWM frequency control
+ change to analog input pins
+ explain what happened
+ separate into another tab
+ fix potential serial issue when blocking functions are used, should instead exhaust the serial buffer before proceeding with the mode function
+ create dedicated getUserVels() to be called in functions such as updateCar()
- Test ultrasonic sensor by writing an obstacle avoidance routine. Using getUserVels(), allow the ultrasonic sensor to contribute to the user vels instead of overwriting them.
-- Add minimal telemetry to existing modes using println
-- figure out issue where getDistance screws up manual control below the limit
