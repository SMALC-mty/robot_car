-- traction control / skew rate limiter
+ fine tune line follower
+ change driver pins to allow separate Enable PWM frequency control
+ change to analog input pins
+ explain what happened
+ separate into another tab
+ fix potential serial issue when blocking functions are used, should instead exhaust the serial buffer before proceeding with the mode function
+ create dedicated getUserVels() to be called in functions such as updateCar()
+ Test ultrasonic sensor by writing an obstacle avoidance routine. Using getUserVels(), allow the ultrasonic sensor to contribute to the user vels instead of overwriting them.
+ improve obstacle avoidance by setting up a PID to reverse when past the threshold
+ re-map pins to allow ultrasonic interrupts. Perhaps HC-05 can be moved to SCL+SDA?
- set up target lock mode (spin until object is detected)
-- Add minimal telemetry to existing modes using println
-- figure out issue where getDistance screws up manual control below the limit
